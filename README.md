In this code I calculated both the Areas and Circumference of Rectangle, Square, and Circle shapes.
Mathematic Formulas: 
Rectangle Area: width * length      Rectangle Circumference: (width * 2) + (length * 2)
Square Area: width * length         Square Circumference: (width * 2) + (lenght * 2)
Circle Area: PI * Radious * Radious          Circle Circumference: PI * Diameter
